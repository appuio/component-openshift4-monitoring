                The overall memory usage is high.
                kube-apiserver and etcd might be slow to respond.
                To fix this, increase memory of the control plane nodes.

                This alert was adjusted to be less sensitive in 4.11.
                Newer Go versions use more memory, if available, to reduce GC pauses.

                Old memory behavior can be restored by setting `GOGC=63`.
                See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2074031 for more details.
